\section{Principle Component Analysis (PCA)}

\subsection{Dataset}

Song dataset with 5000 songs were obtained from the \ac{osca} as mp3 files with 320kbps quality. Then
those 5000 songs were converted to wav format with 16-pcm quality by using ffmpeg library.

\subsection{Features and Tools}

Jaudio library\cite{jaudio} was used to extract 27 different audio features from the song dataset.
Then \ac{svd} function in Matlab\cite{matlab:2018b} was used to composite multi-dimension features
to a single value. Finally \ac{pca} implementation in Matlab\cite{matlab:2018b} used to run the \ac{pca}.
