\section{Audio File Formats}

Every type of digital data needs a file format to be stored in a computer 
system and the file format for digital audio data is audio file format. 
File format should be taken into consideration since audio data could vary 
from different formats in signal processing. Audio file formats can be 
categorized into three major groups.

\subsection{Uncompressed Audio Formats}

Uncompressed audio format is considered as the main type of audio format which takes a larger 
space to be stored but preserves the quality of the sound. It is vastly used on professional 
audio workstations such as the television and film industry.
Eg: WAV, AIFF, CDA


\subsection{Lossless Compressed Audio Formats}

Compared to the above type, lossless compressed audio formats take less space to be stored. 
It maintains a compression ratio of about 2:1 and reduces processing time.
Eg: FLAC, Wav Pack, Monkeyâ€™s audio, ALAC


\subsection{Lossy Compressed Audio Formats}

This type of audio formats reduce the size of the audio file which results in reducing the 
quality of sound as well. But compared to the loss of data and quality, this file format is 
used highly in limited storage capacities.
Eg: Mp3, AAC
