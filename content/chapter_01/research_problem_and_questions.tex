\section{Research Problem and Research Questions}

\subsection{Project Aim}


Aim of this research is to utilize computational theories and tools to protect copyright ownership of artistes in radio broadcasts.


\subsection{Research Questions}

Main three research questions are identified to address the challenges in music identification when
remastered songs are broadcasted in radio. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are forms of alterations to the basic musical facets in remastered music?
    \item What are the approaches of identifying remastered music?
    \item What approach can be used to identify remastered music in radio broadcasts?    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Objectives}

Answers to above research questions are obtained by accomplishing the five objectives. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Gather and identify the alterations made to remastered music when compared with the original music.
    \item Review existing cover song identification methods and music similarity measures to implement feature extraction methods for relevant features.
    \item Identify similarity descriptive features with respect to the identified forms of alterations.
    \item Introduce a new  music similarity descriptor using identified features.
    \item Use introduced music similarity descriptor to identify remastered music in radio broadcasts.      
\end{enumerate}
