\section{Future Works}

This research can be enhanced to identify remastered songs with more
audio alterations which are not covered by this research such as music
additions and music subtractions. And the matching process can be improved
to reduce search space and reduce number of calculations.

Proposed method of this research is implemented as an isolated system, but
it should be implemented with the other parts of the \say{Radio Broadcast 
Monitoring to Ensure Copyright Ownership}\cite{Nishan}, so this method can
be used to identify remastered songs in radio broadcasts.
