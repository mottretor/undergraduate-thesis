\section{Auxiliary Findings}

\subsection{Common Features of False Positives}

Analysis of \ac{fp}s is useful to have an insight about the fingerprinting method. Therefore \ac{stft}
spectrograms and audio clips of \ac{fp}s were analyzed and found that those audio clips contain
rapid key translations compared to an average sinhala song. 

\subsection{Impact on SIFT Descriptor by Tempo Decrease}

It has been observed that accuracy on tempo decreased audio identification has more accuracy than
identification of original songs itself. Hence we can assume that tempo decreasing enhances the invariant
feature which is extracted by the \ac{sift} descriptor on \ac{stft} spectrogram.
