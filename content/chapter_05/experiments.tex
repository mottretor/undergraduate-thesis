%song dataset
\subsection{Song Dataset}
A song dataset consisting 2300 sinhala songs were used in the registration step of the experiment. These 2300 sinhala songs were retrieved from
\ac{osca} of Sri Lanka which works as the governing organization to ensure intellectual property rights of music in Sri Lanka. 

%query audio samples
\subsection{Query Audio Samples}
Variable sized 844 query audio clips were used for the experiment to evaluate the performance of this method
against different durations. 519 of the above mentioned audio clips had songs which are in the database while 325 audio clips didn't have songs from 
the database. Hence for each test case, the sample size was 844 query audio clips with 0.61492 prevalence.    

%test cases
\subsection{Test Cases}
Test cases were created by doing audio distortions to the query audio samples. Performance of the method was evaluated for three main audio distortions
which are tempo alteration, pitch alteration and both pitch and tempo alteration. Both increased and decreased alterations are considered for three different
levels of alterations which are 10\% alteration, 20\% alteration and 50\% alteration. Hence there are 3 audio distortions, 2 audio distortion directions and
3 audio alteration levels, 18 (\(3 \times 2 \times 3\)) test cases were generated to evaluate the performance.
