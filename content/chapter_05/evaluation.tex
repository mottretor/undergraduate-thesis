\section{Evaluation}

Final results of the experiment with keypoint ratio as the threshold measure performs significantly better
than the keypoint count threshold measure. Hence, it can be concluded that keypoint ratio is a better
threshold measure than keypoint count.

There is a sudden drop of accuracies between 20\% and 50\% pitch changes. This sudden drop happens when shifting
up or down on the frequency axis making spectrogram local patterns to be compressed or expanded which makes the pattern
to get unidentified as shown in Figure \ref{fig:spectrogram_down}.
