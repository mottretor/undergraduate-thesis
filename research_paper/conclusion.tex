\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, a novel music similarity descriptor is proposed. Using \gls{sift} descriptors to match 
two \gls{stft} spectrograms suits identification of remastered songs as it can be used to match 
variable sized audio clips with original songs. By using the new descriptor above 96\% accuracy can be 
achieved for tempo alterations up to 50\% and above 95\% accuracy can be achieved for pitch alterations 
up to 20\%. Which makes it robust to audio enhancements performed on music.
