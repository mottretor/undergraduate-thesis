Music identification in radio broadcasts have different use cases like playlist generation
and protecting copyright ownership of artistes. In real world environments, music is often
remastered by radio channels to fit in to limited air times. Mostly those remastering
includes time stretching, pitch shifting and etc. Therefore robustness of the music identification
method plays a crucial role. In this paper, we propose to use \gls{sift} on \gls{stft} spectrogram to extract audio
descriptors. Experiments show that \gls{sift} descriptors exhibit robustness against audio 
distortions such as time stretching and pitch shifting. Finally a ratio based threshold is
used to differentiate identified and non-identified states.
